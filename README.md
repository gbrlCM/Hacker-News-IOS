# Hacker News IOS Reader

## Motivation
This is my first iOS app, I made before the start of my Apple Developer Academy class. My objetive is to learn the basics of iOS app building and use as a playground to develop my skills as beginner software engineer.

## Core Technologies I learned during this process
* UIKit Basics
* Swift
* Combine
* BBF Rest API with Swift using Vapor
* Publishing a Vapor API on Heroku
* Using TypeScript to create a data Mock
* Protocol Oriented Programming basics
* Git with terminal

## App features
This app list the news from the HN feed and as you click you visit the URL embedded in the story.

### Cool stuff
* BFF (Backend for Frontend) API consuming the original HN API. Parsing the data and sending only the necessary for the app.
* Infinite feed like scroll behaviour
* Protocol Oriented Repository making testing easier
* Usage of SplitViewControlller for seamless iPad, iPhone and small windows iPad view transition, choosing the correct view accordingly the screen size
